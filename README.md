A compact website to generate a shortened URL and a QR Code from a long URL. I wanted to implement my kind-of URL shortener as that URL redirecting always amazed me.


## Features

- Paste in a valid URL and the app will generate the shorted URl and QR Code.
- Since this is a small app I tried to make up for it with a 3D CSS design.

## TODO

- Implement more validation on server side.
- Extensive exception handling since wide range of URLs are accepted things can go wrong more easily here.


Technologies used:

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML5 / CSS
- Node.js / Express
- MongoDB
